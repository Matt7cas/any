I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one we know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do
I say, "Ohh"
I say, "Ohh"
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know, I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I will, yes, I will
I said, "Ohh"
I cry, "Ohh"
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out</p>
